Database implemented as sql script and generated by sqlalchemy.orm objects.  Plan will be to create an alembic version that 
creates the database, allowing later migrations and rollbacks

As a component of the application, scrapy is used to obtain current data, based on a location.  Implementation considerations
include loading the locations available on the scraped site or to do a k-nearest neighbors analysis on locations in the database
that are near an entered location by the user

Forms are created for adding bait, gear, and angler ranks.  A basic layout is implemented currently, but this can be improved
once functionality is implemented.  Password hashing is explored in a tester and will be utilized in for a complete version.
